                <p>HOPE is a Non-Governmental & Non-Profitable organization initiated by Sandeep and Aakanksha at Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology. Our mission is to address the basic needs of people in need. We organize various events and programs aimed at fulfilling the necessities of the underprivileged and promoting social welfare.</p>
                <p>In a society that often marginalizes women, HOPE has also established a platform for women empowerment through HOPE Women's Wing. We strongly believe in the principle "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much". Join us in contributing towards serving society and let's be the catalysts for change!</p>
