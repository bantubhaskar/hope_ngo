                     I'm Sandeep! A motive, "The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity" made me initiate HOPE.
                      My vision is to play a formative role in the upliftment of society and the underprivileged sections at large.
                       Being the founder, I have put in enormous efforts for development and growth of the club. 
                       Believing strongly that my work would bring an irreversible change for good!</p>
