                    Iâ€™m Aakanksha! My vision is to give a holistic approach to young girls and help them live a better quality of life.
                     It has been a life-long dream of mine to help young girls who need positive influence and valuable resources that will make a difference in their lives! 
                     This is an exciting time for me, and have been working tirelessly to put together quality workshops that will inspire young girls to know their worth and give them additional tools to become all that they could ever dream of</p>
